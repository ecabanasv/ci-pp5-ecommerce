            <p class="text-justify my-4">Welcome to Ecabanas Bookstore, an online platform that offers a minimal selection (for the moment!) of both fiction and non-fiction books. Inspired by my mother, an avid reader who instilled in me a love for books, my mission is to make it easier for you to access the books you love. Please note that all books, authors, book covers, and publishers featured on this website are fictional and were created for the sake of this project only.</p> 
            <p class="text-justify my-4">I would like to dedicate this project to my mother. She was a great reader and I know she would have loved this bookstore. She inspired me in the love of reading and I hope she would be proud of me for creating this website. I will maintain this project in her memory and I'll improve it as I learn more about web development and new technologies.</p>
